                passion and excitement for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics - STEM for short. Through club meetings,
                collaboration, and community outreach events, we hope to make STEM opportunities accessible to students from all backgrounds.  
                From informing students of extracurricular learning resources and activities, to guiding members through one-on-one tutoring, Northville STEM Enthusiasts (NSE) aim
                to help students learn STEM beyond the classroom and perhaps find a passion in STEM they did not know they had. Additionally, we as a team hope to
                nurture the next generation of students to discover their interests in STEM. From participation in various STEM team competitions, to encouraging members to volunteer
                in various club-held events and fundraisers, NSE aim to nurture a safe place for future students in STEM.`

            because of a strict teacher or mentor. It turns out that there is much more to math than making reptitive calculations and memorizing formulas. Math serves as the building blocks
            for all other subjects and contains many opportunities that are often under-appreciated. Beyond the classroom, math can be used in many creative and ingenius ways that, unfortunately, many
            are unaware of. Math uses a level of intuition that allow many rather-mundane problems to be solved in a more concise, clever method. Math club attempts to explore some of the interesting possibilities in 
            math and highlight the exciting aspects of an commonly-deemed dull, mundane subject. `

             requires adjusting a pre-coded program to imitate the way humans learn. By analyzing the output of our program, we can produce an output that we can measure the accuracy of. 
             How could a machine, an inanimate object, learn in a way that humans can? Suprisingly, we can 'train' a program to act in a way that we desire. Like a child, we can 'reward' a machine for a desirable behavior
             and 'punish' it for an undesirable behavior. When we do this over a long time, our machine can be 'trained' to always recite good behavior. The most exciting aspect of machine learning is that, like a child,
             our newly adjusted or 'trained' program can recite good behavior even in completely new situations the program has never seen before. This means that we can use this concept of 'Machine Learning' to make predictions for 
             pretty much everything- from predicting the weather to predicting the correct response outputted by chatGPT.`

            Why so? It is because data is fundamental in making future predictions. The more data that is available and usable, the better predictions we can make. For example, a social media app can use your liked videos, time spent per video,
            frequency of usage, and even mutal connections to strategically show you videos of interest. Even though data collection requires much time and effort, once obtained, can be used to make powerful, profitable predictions. It turns out that 
            Machine Learning and data management go hand in hand. Data that is properly managed can be fed into a 'trained' program which can output an accurate result. These results can be used to make predictions for real-world events that have not yet happend.
