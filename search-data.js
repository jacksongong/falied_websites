Through club meetings, collaboration, and community outreach events, we hope to make STEM opportunities accessible to students from all backgrounds. From informing students of extracurricular learning resources and activities to guiding members through one-on-one tutoring, Northville STEM Enthusiasts (NSE) aim to help students learn STEM beyond the classroom and perhaps find a passion in STEM they did not know they had. Additionally, we as a team hope to nurture the next generation of students to discover their interests in STEM. From participation in various STEM team competitions to encouraging members to volunteer in various club-held events and fundraisers, NSE aims to nurture a safe place for future students in STEM.`

It seeks to uncover the fundamental principles that govern life processes such as growth, reproduction, metabolism, and adaptation. Instead of focusing solely on memorizing vocabulary and facts, studying biology emphasizes understanding the underlying mechanisms and concepts that explain how living systems function. By exploring the "why" and "how" behind biological phenomena, students develop a deeper comprehension that enables them to think critically, solve problems, and make connections across different areas of science. This approach fosters a true appreciation of the natural world and equips learners with the tools to contribute meaningfully to fields like medicine, environmental conservation, and biotechnology.`

Math serves as the building blocks for all other subjects and contains many opportunities that are often under-appreciated.

                content: `Machine Learning is a topic that is so essential across all fields of STEM, yet, many students have never heard of it. In a nutshell, Machine Learning incorporates any technique that requires adjusting a pre-coded program to imitate the way humans learn. By analyzing the output of our program, we can produce an output that we can measure the accuracy of. How could a machine, an inanimate object, learn in a way that humans can? Surprisingly, we can 'train' a program to act in a way that we desire. Like a child, we can 'reward' a machine for a desirable behavior and 'punish' it for an undesirable behavior. When we do this over a long time, our machine can be 'trained' to always exhibit good behavior. The most exciting aspect of machine learning is that, like a child, our newly adjusted or 'trained' program can exhibit good behavior even in completely new situations the program has never seen before. This means that we can use this concept of 'Machine Learning' to make predictions for pretty much everything—from predicting the weather to predicting the correct response outputted by ChatGPT.`

There is a reason why all the world's largest technology and social media platforms take extreme measures to collect your personal data, whether you know it or not. Why so? It is because data is fundamental in making future predictions. The more data that is available and usable, the better predictions we can make. For example, a social media app can use your liked videos, time spent per video, frequency of usage, and even mutual connections to strategically show you videos of interest. Even though data collection requires much time and effort, once obtained, it can be used to make powerful, profitable predictions. It turns out that Machine Learning and data management go hand in hand. Data that is properly managed can be fed into a 'trained' program which can output an accurate result. These results can be used to make predictions for real-world events that have not yet happened. If you are curious about the different branches of machine learning and its intersection with AI and data science, take a look at the link on the right.`

                                content: `What is research? Perhaps you have heard of high school students participating in such an amazing activity. You too can be involved. To start, make a resume—an example can be found [here](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/resumes-cover-letters/how-to-make-a-resume-with-examples). Then, you can start sending [cold emails](https://www.polygence.org/blog/how-to-cold-email-professors) out to university professors. Surprisingly, faculty at many great schools like [Wayne State](https://clas.wayne.edu/faculty-staff), [Oakland University](https://oakland.edu/faculty-and-staff/), and [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/faculty-staff) offer opportunities to high school students! Usually, the best time to reach out is around March-April, as this time of year professors are looking for new students for the summer.

Simply search for the field that interests you, then click on professors in each field. Usually, you may need to send tens to hundreds of emails to get an acceptance. Good luck!`

                content: `Using a large range of algorithms is essential for solving complex computational problems efficiently. Graph theory algorithms, such as Dijkstra's or Floyd-Warshall, are commonly used to find shortest paths in weighted networks, ideal for scenarios involving routing or connectivity. Dynamic programming plays a crucial role in optimizing decisions over time or stages, suitable for maximizing or minimizing certain criteria like costs or distances; this approach can solve problems related to resource allocation or scheduling. Greedy algorithms are invaluable for problems where making the locally optimal choice at each step leads to a globally optimal solution, often applied in task scheduling or minimizing resource usage scenarios. Additionally, data structures like segment trees and binary indexed trees are pivotal for managing and updating large datasets dynamically, aiding in range query problems. Mastery of these algorithms equips participants to tackle a wide array of problem types with efficiency and accuracy.

                title: 'Big-O Notation',
                content: `Big-O notation is a crucial concept in computer science used to describe the upper bound of an algorithm’s performance in terms of time or space complexity as the input size grows. It focuses on the worst-case scenario, omitting constants and lower-order terms to simplify comparison between algorithms. For instance, complexities like O(n), O(n²), and O(log n) denote linear, quadratic, and logarithmic growth rates, respectively. This notation helps in understanding how execution time or space requirements scale with increasing input size, providing a theoretical measure of efficiency irrespective of machine-specific details. Common complexities include O(1) for constant time, O(n log n) for log-linear time often seen in efficient sorting algorithms, and O(2ⁿ) or O(n!) for exponential and factorial growths seen in brute-force strategies, which become impractical as input sizes increase.
