             Machine Learning is a topic that is so essential across all fields of STEM, yet, many students have never heard of it. In a nutshell, Machine Learning incorporates any technique that 
             requires adjusting a pre-coded program to imitate the way humans learn. By analyzing the output of our program, we can produce an output that we can measure the accuracy of. 
             How could a machine, an inanimate object, learn in a way that humans can? Suprisingly, we can 'train' a program to act in a way that we desire. Like a child, we can 'reward' a machine for a desirable behavior
             and 'punish' it for an undesirable behavior. When we do this over a long time, our machine can be 'trained' to always recite good behavior. The most exciting aspect of machine learning is that, like a child,
             our newly adjusted or 'trained' program can recite good behavior even in completely new situations the program has never seen before. This means that we can use this concept of 'Machine Learning' to make predictions for 
             pretty much everything- from predicting the weather to predicting the correct response outputted by chatGPT.

        <p>   
            In today's world, data is perhaps the most valuable resource. There is a reason why all the world's largest technology and social media platforms take extreme measures to collect your personal data, whether you know it or not.
            Why so? It is because data is fundamental in making future predictions. The more data that is available and usable, the better predictions we can make. For example, a social media app can use your liked videos, time spent per video,
            frequency of usage, and even mutal connections to strategically show you videos of interest. Even though data collection requires much time and effort, once obtained, can be used to make powerful, profitable predictions. It turns out that 
            Machine Learning and data management go hand in hand. Data that is properly managed can be fed into a 'trained' program which can output an accurate result. These results can be used to make predictions for real-world events that have not yet happend.

        <p>   
            Due to the vast use cases for machine learning, many fields of STEM research rely on machine learning to make progress. An example of this is in physics and biology research. Both disciplines rely on powerful machine learning algorithms to predict what will happen
            in new situations. In physics, that could be predicting the behavior of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system" target="_blank" class="remind-link">complex system</a>. In biology, that could be 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning_in_bioinformatics#:~:text=Machine%20learning%20can%20aid%20in,classification%2C%20and%20genetic%20network%20induction.&text=This%20technology%20is%20especially%20useful,examining%20which%20genes%20are%20expressed." target="_blank" class="remind-link">pattern recognition and classification</a>. 
            In any scenario, most (if not all) theoretical STEM research use some aspect of machine learning to make calculations. At NHS Machine Learning Club, we aim to guide memebers in their understanding of machine learning and its use cases in each step of the research proccess.

        <h2>Our Club</h2>

    <div class = "body_font", style="margin-bottom: 150px;">
        <p>   
            Our club aims to simplify the often-overcomplicated field of machine learning by making the learning experiance as fun and interactive as possible. We play with pre-made models and experiment with outputs when given different inputs, exploring the factors that effect the performance of a predicitive model. 
            We will also teach members how to initiate and set-up their own coding projects so that we as a club can build our own machine learning models from scratch. Machine Learning Club strives to bring excitement to the various applications of machine learning through its applications in scientific research. Our club hopes to 
            assist members in finding their own research opportunities and find ways of applying machine learning to both their individual research as well as personal projects.

        The president will run after-school math club meetings and occasional leadership meetings. 
        The president will visit tutoring meetings at NHS and coach MATHCOUTNS tutors for the Northville middle schools. 
        The president is the person to contact only when there are issues with club activities that cannot be resolved otherwise. 
        Leaders should look for ways to solve issues independently and the president will give suggestions during leadership meetings.    </p>
