        <h1>Why Math?</h1>
    </div>

    <div class = "body_font", style="margin-bottom: 150px;">
        <p>   
            Math is a subject often misunderstood and disliked by many students. Why so? Perhaps its the memorization of steps and execution of boring calculations. Perhaps its
            because of a strict teacher or mentor. It turns out that there is much more to math than making reptitive calculations and memorizing formulas. Math serves as the building blocks
            for all other subjects and contains many opportunities that are often under-appreciated. Beyond the classroom, math can be used in many creative and ingenius ways that, unfortunately, many
            are unaware of. Math uses a level of intuition that allow many rather-mundane problems to be solved in a more concise, clever method. Math club attempts to explore some of the interesting possibilities in 
            math and highlight the exciting aspects of an commonly-deemed dull, mundane subject.

            NHS Math Club aims to bring excitement to mathematics all while helping students through tutoring. During after school meetings, we play mathematical games, explore interesting 
            concepts, and train for competitions, including the AMC, Caribou, and Purple Comet competitions. We strive to provide a safe-place for similar-minded students to share their interest in mathematics beyond the classroom.
            Our club strives to change members' perspective of math from a boring, reptitive chore to a subject they can enjoy and cherish. Math club hopes to foster problem-solving and critical thinking skills in addition to the math cirriculum taught in school.
            If you are interested, you can sign up using <a href="https://www.remind.com/classes/nvmath21/messages/stream/2ead0bfb-235d-4812-9980-345eeaa8df35" target="_blank" class="remind-link">remind</a> to join the emailing list.

        <p>   
            In addition to after school meetings, math club also provides math tutoring services to students from all math levels. Run by math club volunteers, 
            the NHS Math Tutoring Program hopes to provide accessible one-on-one peer tutoring for all students. We strive to provide a welcoming, comfortable enviroment for students to learn math at their own pace, without judgement.
            Our tutoring meetings are hosted either weekly or biweekly during seminar time in Mr.Kinney's room 242. If you are interested in recieving free assistance from someone who has already taken and excelled in your current math class, sign up using
            the google form on the right to join our email list. All updates and meeting times will be posted there.

        <p>   
            In addition to our involvement at Northville High School, our club also helps the next generation of students develop a passion for mathematics. 
            Through the MATHCOUNTS organization, a national math competition for middle school students, our club volunteers coach students at both Hillside and Meads Mill middle schools.
            Through our coaching, both middle schools have advanced to the State Competition. We also aim to inform middle-school students of math opportunities in high school, such as the AMC 
            competitions and high school volunteering.

                The president is the person to contact only when there are issues with club activities that cannot be resolved otherwise.
