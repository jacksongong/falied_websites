# EduCater

Still in development as of 06/03/2024 (MM/DD/YYYY)

EduCater is a tool catered specifically for migrant children, or any children, who are looking to learn social normalities and the specific national curriculum for their country. 
* **Tutor**: EduCater is an excellent tutoring tool for kids to use as supplemental material, from teaching children mathematics and sciences, to environmental education (which is mandated by the Indian government, as an example)
* **Teacher**: Can cover topics that real, public schools in specific countries would cover themselves, strengthening the ideas and concepts of a user's imagination. EduCater can act as a teacher on its own.
* **Social Skills**: EduCater emphasizes social norms, so that a kid does not feel left out or strange because socially, they do not fit in. It teaches important social skills and social normalities that are specific to a country.
* **Contribution**: EduCater is open source and also open for use under the MIT License. Give proper credit where credit is due.
* **Containing**: EduCater is largely compatible and can be used along your other website resources.
* **Database**: EduCater utilizes MongoDB for its efficient and cheap database.

EduCater supports all major browsers such as: Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, Opera (and GX), Apple Safari, and more.

## Contribution

#### EduCater is looking for translators.
* If you would like to help EduCater with translations, you will certainly be credited. We are looking for people fluent in the following languages to help:
    * Mandarin Chinese
    * Spanish
    * Japanese
    * Hindi
    * Russian
    * Portugese
    * German
    * French
* Let it be noted that if we cannot find anyone fluent in the language to contribute to EduCater, the language may be disregarded as a whole to avoid offense toward anyone for bad or falsified translations--for some languages, we may use AI translators, such as Google Translate.

#### EduCater would be happy to invite new developers or creative directors.

EduCater is fully open source. If you would like to contribute, we would be happy and encourage you to! Feel free to submit any ideas or contributions to our team, and we will credit you accordingly. 

#### We care about upholding diversity and avoiding potentially persecuting terms or translations.

EduCater is very open to new ideas and viewpoints, as we want to make sure it is acceptable as it is meant to be a diverse website.

If anything the website has done has offended anyone of any social level, ethnicity, gender, or sexual orientation, we will consider the complaint very seriously and make sure nothing like the complaint filed will ever happen again. We will also make sure to give credit for any discrimination or offense complaints that are found to be reasonably corrected.
