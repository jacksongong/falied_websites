            <h3>How to Find Research as a High Schooler</h3>
            <p>What is research? Perhaps you have heard of high school students participating in such an amazing activity. You too can be involved. To start, make a resume- an example can be found <a href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/resumes-cover-letters/how-to-make-a-resume-with-examples" target="_blank">here</a>. Then, you can start sending 
                <a href="https://www.polygence.org/blog/how-to-cold-email-professors" target="_blank">cold emails</a> out to university professors. Suprisingly, faculty at many great school like <a href="https://clas.wayne.edu/faculty-staff" target="_blank">Wayne State</a>, <a href="https://oakland.edu/faculty-and-staff/" target="_blank">Oakland University</a>, and <a href="https://msu.edu/faculty-staff" target="_blank">Michigan State University</a>
            offer opportunities to high school students! Usually, the best time to reach out is around March-April, as this time of year professors are looking for new students for the summer. <br><br> Simply search for the field that interests you, then click on professors in each field. Usually, you may need to send tens to hundreds of emails to get an acceptance. Good luck!</p>
